# Types
1.	__Square__ if m == n.
2.	__Diagonal__ – diagonal entries != 0 and all other entries == 0.
3.	__Scalar__ – diagonal entries are equal.
4.	__Identity__ – diagonal entries are 1 and the rest other are 0.
5.	__Triangular__ (upper | lower) – entries above | below the diagonals are nonzero && entries below | above are zeros.
6.	__Singular__ – determinant is zero.
7.	__Nonsingular__ – nonzero determinant.
8.	__Elementary__ – Matrix generated by doing 1 [[eliminations#Elemetary Row Operations|ERO]] from an identity.
9.	__Adjoint__ – transpose of cofactor matrix.

# Operations
* Addition
* Scalar multiplication
* Matrix multiplication
    * Only defined if inner dimensions are equal - A (m by n) && B (n by p):
    *.	Multiply corresponding rows of the leftmost matrix to that of the corresponding columns of rightmost matrix.
*	A (m by n) && B (n by p): inner dimensions must be equal.

# Inverse
4.	Matrix Inverse
* 1x = x
* A * A-1 = A-1  * A = Eye
* Solving SLEs:
1.	Adjoin the matrix and the equivalent Identity.
2.	Convert the adjoined matrix to RREF.
3.	If not possible then A is noninvertible | singular.
4.	If Ax = b then x = A^-1 b.
