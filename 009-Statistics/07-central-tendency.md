# Central Tendency | Ungrouped

## Ungrouped
1. __arithmetic mean | average__ -
$$
\begin{aligned}
\bar{x} = \dfrac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n x_i}{n}
\end{aligned}
$$
2. __Weigthed mean__ - 
$$
\begin{aligned}
\overline{x} = \dfrac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n w_i x_i}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n w_i}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Grouped
### 1. __mean__ - 
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mu = \dfrac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^N x_i}{N}
\end{aligned}
$$

### 1. __median | x̃ | Md__

   * middle of sorted collection
   * if even size, avg the two centers.
### 2. __mode | X̂ | Mo__ - most frequent value
#### Names: 
* Modal
* Bimodal
* Trimodal
* Multimodal
* Amodal - no mode
#### Approximation
1. Mode
$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat{x}_m = l + \dfrac{f_1 - f_0}{2(f_1 - f_0 - f_2)} h
\end{aligned}
$$
 where: 
   
    __^m​__ is the approximation of the mode

    __l__ is the lower class boundary of the modal class

    __f1​__ is F of the modal class

    __f0​__ is F of class interval below the modal class

    __f2​__ is F of class interval above the modal class

    __h__ is the class interval width
3. Median
$$
\hat{x}_M = l + \dfrac{n + 1}{2} - c \cdot h
$$

 where:

    __x^m​__ where: is the approximation of the mode

    __x^M​__ is the approximation of the median

    __l__ is the lower class boundary of the modal class

    __f1​__ is the frequency of the modal class

    __f0​__ is the frequency of the class interval below the modal class

    __f2​__ is the frequency of the class interval above the modal class

    __h__ is the class interval width

    __n__ is the total number of data points

    __c__ is the cumulative frequency of the class interval below the median class

    __f__ is the frequency of the median class
