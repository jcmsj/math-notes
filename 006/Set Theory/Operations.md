## 1. Union
* $A \cup B$
* Combination
## 2. Intersection
* $A \cap B$
* $\forall x \;in\; A \And B$
## 3. Difference
* $A - B$
* $\forall x \;not\;in\; A \And B$
## 4. Complement
* All elements not in A
* $\bar{A} = U - A$

## Cardinality
* $n(A)$ or $|A|$ is the set's size
* Cardinal Number
## 5. Cartesian Product
*  The Cartesian product of set A and B, written as A x B is the set of all possible ordered pairs. 
*  First element from A and second element from B. 
*  $A \;X \;B = \{ \left(a, b\right) |\; a \in  A \And b \in B \}$
## 6. Power Set
* Given set A, written $2^A$, is the set of all subsets of A including itself and $\emptyset$.
