# Set Theory
## Introduction
German mathematician G. Cantor introduced the concept of sets. He had defined a set as a
collection of definite and distinguishable objects selected using certain rules or description.
### SET
* Is a collection of well defined objects. 
* Denoted by capital letters of the alphabet and its members are enclosed with brackets.
When talking about sets, it is fairly standard to use Capital Letters to represent the set, and
lowercase letters to represent an element in that set.
Elements — are the members or objects of the set which is denoted by a symbol (E

### Representation
1. Roster Method | Tabular Form
2. Rule method | Set Builder Notation
