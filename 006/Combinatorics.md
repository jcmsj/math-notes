# Combinatorics
## Principles of Counting | PoC
If a choice consists of two steps, of which the first can be made in n<sub>1</sub> ways and the
second can be made in n<sub>2</sub> ways, then the whole choice can be made in n<sub>1</sub>n<sub>2</sub> ways.
## Generalization of PoC
The Generalization of PoC states that if a choice of k steps, of which the first can be made in  n<sub>1</sub> ways, of each of these the second can be made in n<sub>2</sub> ways,…, and for each of these the kth can be made  n<sub>k</sub> ways, then the whole choice can be made in n<sub>1</sub>n<sub>2</sub>...n<sub>k</sub> ways.
## Permutations
### Arrangement of n distinct objects:
* nP<sub>n</sub>=  P(n,n) = n!
### Arrangement of n distinct objects taken r at a time
* nPr = n! / (n-r) !
### Arrangement of some alike objects
* n! / n<sub>1</sub>n<sub>2</sub>...n<sub>k</sub>
### Circular Permutation
* _def_: objects arranged in a circle.
* (n-1)!
* circular permutation for alike objects
## Combinations
* _def_: Arrangement disregarding order.
* Selecting r objects taken n at a time is
<br>C(n,r) = n! / r!(n-r)! = nCr
